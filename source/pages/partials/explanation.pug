      p
        | Nearly everything on the Internet starts with a DNS request. DNS is the Internet’s directory. Click on a link, open an app, send an email and the first thing your device does is ask the directory:
        | <strong class="subtle">Where can I find this?</strong>

        | Unfortunately, by default, DNS is usually slow and insecure. Your ISP, and anyone else listening in on the Internet, can see every site you visit and every app you use — even if their content is encrypted. Creepily, some DNS providers sell data about your Internet activity or use it target you with ads.

      p We think that’s gross. If you do too, now there’s an alternative: <strong>1.1.1.1</strong>

      p We’re rethinking the 1983-era DNS protocol. <strong>1.1.1.1</strong> supports encrypted DNS as well as DNS over HTTPS.

      p Frankly, we don't want to know what you do on the Internet—it’s none of our business—and we’ve taken the technical steps to ensure we can’t.

      p We’ve built 1.1.1.1 to be the Internet’s fastest DNS directory. Don’t take our word for it. The independent DNS monitor DNSPerf ranks 1.1.1.1 the fastest DNS service in the world.

      p Since nearly everything you do on the Internet starts with a DNS request, choosing the fastest DNS directory across all your devices will accelerate almost everything you do online.
