      p
        | Nearly everything on the Internet starts with a DNS request. DNS is the Internet's directory. Click on a link, open an app, send an email and the first thing your device does is ask the directory:
        | <strong>Where can I find this?</strong>

      p
        | Unfortunately, by default, DNS is usually slow and insecure. Your ISP, and anyone else listening in on the Internet, can see every site you visit and every app you use — even if their content is encrypted. Creepily, some DNS providers sell data about your Internet activity or use it target you with ads.

      p We think that's gross. If you do too, now there's an alternative: <strong>1.1.1.1 DNS Resolver</strong>

        | We will never log your IP address (the way other companies identify you). And we’re not just saying that. We’ve retained <a href="https://home.kpmg.com/us/en/home.html" target="_blank">KPMG</a> to audit our systems annually to ensure that we're doing what we say.

      p Frankly, we don't want to know what you do on the Internet—it’s none of our business—and we’ve taken the technical steps to ensure we can’t.

      h1.collapsed-top-margin 20% faster than anything else

      p We’ve built 1.1.1.1 to be the Internet’s fastest DNS directory. Don’t take our word for it. The independent DNS monitor DNSPerf ranks 1.1.1.1 the fastest DNS service in the world.

      p Since nearly everything you do on the Internet starts with a DNS request, choosing the fastest DNS directory across all your devices will accelerate almost everything you do online.
