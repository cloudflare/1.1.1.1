  "explanation.dnsHeader": "DNS: Internet’s Directory",
  "explanation.dnsExplanation": "Nearly everything on the Internet starts with a DNS request. DNS is the Internet’s directory. Click on a link, open an app, send an email and the first thing your device does is ask the directory: <strong class=\"subtle\">Where can I find this?</strong>",
  "explanation.dnsSlowInsecure": "Unfortunately, by default, DNS is usually slow and insecure. Your ISP, and anyone else listening in on the Internet, can see every site you visit and every app you use — even if their content is encrypted. Creepily, some DNS providers sell data about your Internet activity or use it target you with ads.",
  "explanation.dnsAlternative": "We think that’s gross. If you do too, now there’s an alternative: <strong>1.1.1.1</strong>",

  "explanation.privacyGuaranteeLogs": "<span class=\"mobile-emphasis\">We will never log your IP address</span> (the way other companies identify you). And we’re not just saying that. We’ve retained an external auditor to audit our systems annually to ensure that we're doing what we say.",
  "explanation.privacyConclusion": "Frankly, we don’t want to know what you do on the Internet—it’s none of our business—and we’ve taken the technical steps to ensure we can’t.",

  "explanation.fastestDNS": "We’ve built 1.1.1.1 to be the Internet’s fastest DNS directory. Don’t take our word for it. The independent DNS monitor DNSPerf ranks 1.1.1.1 the fastest DNS service in the world.",
  "explanation.speedContinued": "Since nearly everything you do on the Internet starts with a DNS request, choosing the fastest DNS directory across all your devices will accelerate almost everything you do online.",

  "faq.networkContinued": "Cloudflare had the network. APNIC had the IP address (1.1.1.1). Both of us were motivated by a mission to help build a better Internet.
