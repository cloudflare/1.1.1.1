  "explanation.dnsHeader": "DNS: Internet’s Directory",
  "explanation.dnsExplanation": "Nearly everything on the Internet starts with a DNS request. DNS is the Internet’s directory. Click on a link, open an app, send an email and the first thing your device does is ask the directory: <strong class=\"subtle\">Where can I find this?</strong>",
  "explanation.dnsSlowInsecure": "Unfortunately, by default, DNS is usually slow and insecure. Your ISP, and anyone else listening in on the Internet, can see every site you visit and every app you use — even if their content is encrypted. Creepily, some DNS providers sell data about your Internet activity or use it target you with ads.",
  "explanation.dnsAlternative": "We think that’s gross. If you do too, now there’s an alternative: <strong>1.1.1.1</strong>",

  "explanation.privacyHeader": "Privacy First: Guaranteed.",
  "explanation.privacyExplanation": "We’re rethinking the 1983-era DNS protocol. <strong>1.1.1.1</strong> supports encrypted DNS as well as DNS over HTTPS.",
  "explanation.privacyGuaranteeData": "<span class=\"mobile-emphasis\">We will never sell your data or use it to target ads.</span> Period.",
  "explanation.privacyGuaranteeLogs": "<span class=\"mobile-emphasis\">We will never log your IP address</span> (the way other companies identify you). And we’re not just saying that. We’ve retained KPMG to audit our systems annually to ensure that we're doing what we say.",
  "explanation.privacyConclusion": "Frankly, we don’t want to know what you do on the Internet—it’s none of our business—and we’ve taken the technical steps to ensure we can’t.",

  "explanation.performanceHeader": "Faster than anything else.",
  "explanation.performanceSubheader": "28% faster, in fact.",
  "explanation.fastestDNS": "We’ve built 1.1.1.1 to be the Internet’s fastest DNS directory. Don’t take our word for it. The independent DNS monitor <a href='https://www.dnsperf.com/#!dns-resolvers' target='_blank'>DNSPerf</a> ranks 1.1.1.1 the fastest DNS service in the world.",
  "explanation.speedContinued": "Since nearly everything you do on the Internet starts with a DNS request, choosing the fastest DNS directory across all your devices will accelerate almost everything you do online.",
